h1. OutputDebugString Monitor: Catching Win32 debug string events from Java

This set of bundles provides access to the output created by calls to the Win32 kernel API function "OutputDebugString":http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363362%28VS.85%29.aspx.

It also provides you the ability to use this function from Java.

h2. Bundles

The project contains different bundles described here shortly.

* outputdebugstring.core - Monitor and OutputDebugString function for Java
* outputdebugstring.ui - View for incoming debug strings
* outputdebugstring.osgi.component - An OSGi component for the Monitor class
* outputdebugstring.osgi.log - logs debug strings using the OSGi LogService
* outputdebugstring.osgi.event - publishes events for debug strings using the OSGi EventAdmin

Please note, that all the OSGi services are lazy loaded only if the referenced services (LogService, EventAdmin) are available. If no service publishes the @Listener@ interface the Monitor Component will not be instantiated.
